		<p>
			The first suggestion that all organisms may have had a common ancestor and diverged
			through random variation and natural selection was made in 1745 by the French
			mathematician and scientist Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis (1698-1759) in his work
			Venus physique. Specifically:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			"Could one not say that, in the fortuitous combinations of the productions of nature,
			as there must be some characterized by a certain relation of fitness which are able
			to subsist, it is not to be wondered at that this fitness is present in all the
			species that are currently in existence? Chance, one would say, produced an
			innumerable multitude of individuals; a small number found themselves constructed in
			such a manner that the parts of the animal were able to satisfy its needs; in another
			infinitely greater number, there was neither fitness nor order: all of these latter
			have perished. Animals lacking a mouth could not live; others lacking reproductive
			organs could not perpetuate themselves... The species we see today are but the
			smallest part of what blind destiny has produced..."
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			In 1790, Immanuel Kant (Konigsberg (Kaliningrad) 1724 - 1804), in his Kritik der
			Urtheilskraft, states that the analogy of animal forms implies a common original type
			and thus a common parent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Charles Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, hypothesized in 1795 that all
			warm-blooded animals were descended from a single "living filament":
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			"...would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from
			one living filament, which THE GREAT FIRST CAUSE endued with animality...?"
			(Zoonomia, 1795, section 39, "Generation")
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			In 1859, Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species was published. The views about common
			descent expressed therein vary between suggesting that there was a single "first
			creature" to allowing that there may have been more than one. Here are the relevant
			quotations from the Conclusion:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			"[P]robably all of the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have
			descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed." "The
			whole history of the world, as at present known, ... will hereafter be recognised as
			a mere fragment of time, compared with the ages which have elapsed since the first
			creature, the progenitor of innumerable extinct and living descendants, was created."
			"When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of
			some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian system was
			deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled."
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			The famous closing sentence describes the "grandeur in this view of life, with its
			several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one." The
			phrase "one form" here seems to hark back to the phrase "some few beings"; in any
			case, the choice of words is remarkable for its consistency with recent ideas about
			there having been a single ancestral "genetic pool".

		Evidence of universal common descent
	</h3>
	<div class="element atStart">
		<h4>
			Common biochemistry and genetic code
		</h4>
		<p>
			All known forms of life are based on the same fundamental biochemical organisation:
			genetic information encoded in DNA, transcribed into RNA, through the effect of
			protein- and RNA-enzymes, then translated into proteins by (highly similar)
			ribosomes, with ATP, NADH and others as energy currencies, etc. Furthermore, the
			genetic code (the "translation table" according to which DNA information is
			translated into proteins) is nearly identical for all known lifeforms, from bacteria
			to humans, with minor local differences. The universality of this code is generally
			regarded by biologists as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal
			common descent. Analysis of the small differences in the genetic code has also
			provided support for universal common descent.[2]
		</p>
		<h4>
			Irrelevant differences
		</h4>
		<p>
			Differences which have no relevance to evolution and therefore cannot be explained by
			convergence, tend to be very compelling support for the universal common descent
			theory.
		</p>
		<p>
			Such evidence has come from two domains: amino acid sequences and DNA sequences.
			Proteins with the same 3-d structure need not have identical amino acid sequences;
			any irrelevant similarity between the sequences is evidence for common descent. In
			certain cases, there are several codons (DNA triplets) that code for the same amino
			acid. Thus, if two species use the same codon at the same place to specify an amino
			acid that can be represented by more than one codon, that is evidence for recency of
			a common ancestor.

		class="float-right" />
		<p>
			The universality of many aspects of cellular life is often pointed to as supportive
			evidence to the more compelling evidence listed above. These similarities include the
			energy carrier ATP, and the fact that all amino acids found in proteins are
			left-handed. It is possible that these similarities resulted because of the laws of
			physics and chemistry, rather than universal common descent and therefore resulted in
			convergent evolution.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Phylogenetic trees
		</h4>
		<p>
			Another important piece of evidence is that it is possible to construct detailed
			phylogenetic trees mapping out the proposed divisions and common ancestors of
			species, and no matter what method is used, morphological (based on appearance,
			embryology, etc) or molecular (based on mutation rates and relative similarities of
			important, conserved genes), still get extremely similar results. If there were no
			common ancestor, these different methods should give wildly different results, thus
			the phylogenetic tree is strong evidence of common descent.

		Examples of common descent

		<h4>
			Artificial selection
		</h4>
		<p>
			Artificial selection offers remarkable examples of the amount of diversity that can
			exist between individuals sharing a late common ancestor. To perform artificial
			selection, one begins with a particular species (following examples include wolves
			and wild cabbage) and then, at every generation, only allow certain individuals to
			reproduce, based on the degree to which they exhibit certain desirable
			characteristics. In time, it is expected that these characteristics become
			increasingly well-developed in successive generations. Many examples of artificial
			selection, like the ones below, occurred without the guidance of modern scientific
			insight.

		<h4>
			Dog breeding
		</h4><img src=

		class="float-right" />
		<p>
			An obvious example of the power of artificial selection is the diversity found in
			various breed in domesticated dogs. The various breeds of dogs all share common
			ancestry (being all ultimately descended from wolves) but were domesticated by humans
			and then selectively bred in order to enhance various features such as coat color and
			length or body size. To see the wide range of difference between the many breeds of
			dogs compare the Chihuahua, Great Dane, Basset Hound, Pug, and Poodle. Also compare
			this enormous diversity with the relative uniformity of wild wolves.
